**#SNP dataset for *Paepalanthus longiciliatus* (Ericoaulaceae)**



This dataset consists of a filtered set of genome-wide SNPs generated using a MIG-seq approach. The final VCF contains only high-confidence, biallelic SNPs with complete data across all individuals and was used in all population genetic analyses in the associated study. Detailed information on read processing, SNP calling, and filtering criteria is provided in the Methods section of the manuscript.
